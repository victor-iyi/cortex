# Cortex

Cortex is an API for communicating with your emotiv EEG device.

## Before you start

To run the existing example you will need to do a few things.

1. You will need an EMOTIV headset. You can purchase a headset in our [online store][emotiv]

2. Next, [download and install][developer] the Cortex service. Please note that
currently, the Cortex service is only available for Windows and macOS.

3. We have updated our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and EULA to comply with GDPR.
Please login via the EMOTIV Launcher to read and accept our latest policies in
order to proceed using the following examples.

4. Next, to get a client id and a client secret, you must connect to your Emotiv
account on [emotiv.com][emotiv-account] and create a Cortex app. If you don't
have a EmotivID, you can [register here].

5. Then, if you have not already, you will need to login with your Emotiv id in
the EMOTIV Launcher.

6. Finally, the first time you run these examples, you also need to authorize
them in the EMOTIV Launcher.
